# adaboost_mrt

This is a library with code for Adaboost.MRT


Reconstructed based on the work presented in:
Kummer, Nikolai, and Homayoun Najjaran. "Adaboost. MRT: Boosting regression for multivariate estimation." Artif. Intell. Res. 3.4 (2014): 64-76.

_Note_ that the original work was done in Matlab and this git repo is an implementation of that procedure in python.
