# adaboost_mrt

This repo is a library with code for ***Adaboost.MRT: Boosting regression for multivariate estimation***

Adaboost.MRT is an ensemble multivariate regression extension of Adaboost.RT. It boosts the accuracy of a number of weak learners to create a single strong ensemble predictor.


***Note:*** The original work outlined in the paper was done in Matlab and this git repo is an implementation of that procedure in python. Results may not be the same as the implementation of the base learners is different in Matlab and Python.


Reconstructed based on the work presented in the following paper:
